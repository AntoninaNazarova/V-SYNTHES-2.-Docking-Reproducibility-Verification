# V-SYNTHES-2.-Docking-Reproducibility-Verification
 The current repository contains scripts designed to verify the reproducibility of docking results from the V-SYNTHES 2.* pipeline. Specifically, it calculates the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the fully enumerated molecule and its corresponding MEL fragment before enumeration. In the case of the 2-component reaction setup, two synthons are needed for the structure of the fully enumerated molecule. For the 3-component and 275592-component reaction setups, three synthons are required to construct the fully enumerated molecule. Therefore, for the 3-component and 275592-component reactions, users have the option to calculate the RMSD in three stages: first, between the initial MEL set and the first-round enumerated set; second, between this first-round enumerated set and the final second-round enumerated set; and finally, between the initial MEL set and the final second-round enumerated set.
